Configuration is an object that you add in your JavaScript file. It allows you to initialize FBAC and customise it to your needs. It is split to a few different categories, which makes it easier to understand the concept behind it. Most of the fields within configuration has its default state, which you don't need to update or overwrite - unless you want to change it.

In next chapters, you will learn about each of the fields that you may use for your configuration.
